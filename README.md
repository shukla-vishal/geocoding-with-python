# geocoding-with-python
Geocoding :
Geocoding refers to the process of taking inputs such as an address or the name of a place in the form of text, and returning latitude-longitude information i.e. location on the Earth’s surface for that place.

Reverse Geocoding :
Reverse Geocoding is a process which takes geographic coordinates (latitude-longitude) information as input and results in the description of a location such as a name, address.

Why Do We Need Geocoding?
As compared to traditional address systems, geocoding has some advantages such as-

High Precision & Accuracy:
Traditional address systems can be sometime unprecise, and it can contain spelling mistakes due to inevitable human errors.
geocoding, on the other hand, is more precise and accurate and therefore does not create confusion.

Geocoding makes it easy with the universal acceptable system. Data is guaranteed to be consistent, straightforward and clear.


In this, we will use the table from Wikipedia

We will geocode the addresses of National Parks In India

To start with, we need to import the required libraries which will help us to achieve our objectives:

1) Geocoding the addresses using Geopandas Library

2) Plotting and Visualization using Folium.
